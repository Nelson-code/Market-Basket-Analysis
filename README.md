# Market-Basket-Analysis
As part of this repository, I performed an EDA on bread basket dataset and applied Apriori and FP growth algorithms for association rule mining.
Association rule mining is a technique to identify underlying relations between different items. Ex: Movie streaming platforms like Netflix uses these kind of techniques to suggest you the movies based on your watch history.
Different statistical algorithms have been developed to implement association rule mining, and Apriori and FP growth are one of those algorithms. Both of these algorithms are used to generate frequent itemsets based on the user transactions and later associations rules are derived from the frequent itemsets.

So next time when you are seeing any sort of recommendations (or) on the internet, there could be a higher chances of involvement of these two algorithms.
